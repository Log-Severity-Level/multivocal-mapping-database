,Rust Lang,Designates hazardous situations.
,Log4J,An event that might possible lead to an error
,SLF4J,The WARN level designates potentially harmful situations.
,Commons Logging,"Use of deprecated APIs, poor use of API, 'almost' errors, other runtime situations that are undesirable or unexpected, but not necessarily ""wrong"". Expect these to be immediately visible on a status console."
,Bunyan,A note on something that should probably be looked at by an operator eventually.
,Microsoft.Extensions.Logging,"Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application
flow, but do not otherwise cause the application execution to stop."
,Monolog,Exceptional occurrences that are not errors
,Log4Php,Potentially harmful situations which still allow the application to continue running.
